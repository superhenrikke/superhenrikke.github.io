# About

Hi! I'm Henrikke Dybvik. I find research extremely interesting. I'm currently working on my PhD at [TrollLABs](https://www.ntnu.edu/mtp/trolllabs) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/). 

My research centers around designing and conducting experiments that usually include physiology sensors. By physiology sensors I mean fNIRS, EEG, ECG and GSR. I believe that physiology sensors can be valuable for interface design, product development and product evaluation. I also research design cognition.
