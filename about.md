# About

Hi! I'm Henrikke Dybvik. I find research extremely interesting. I'm a PhD Candidate at [TrollLABs](https://www.ntnu.edu/mtp/trolllabs) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/). 

My research centers around engineering design and human-computer interaction (HCI) through designing and conducting experiments involving physiology sensors and neuroimaging modalities. Such experiments can be valuable for interface design, product development and product evaluation. I use fNIRS, EEG, ECG and GSR. It is multidisciplinary—at the interface of cognitive science, design, engineering and HCI. I aim to understand how to design and develop the products that most effectively solve real problems. Research on design neurocognition, creativity, cognitive activity, and engineering design will contribute insights to this end. My ultimate academic goal is to reverse-engineer the design process of the very best technological solutions through the interface of neuroscience, engineering, and experimental research. I believe this research will contribute to developing better solutions serving the current needs of the planet.
