# Hellow Worlds of superhenrikkes worlds


### Henrikke Dybviks interests
I do experimental research on humans even though I'm a mechanical engineer. The humans eventually interact with the machines and the products, which is important to mention. To understand the product interaction effects on humans I experiment with wearable physiology sensors, ECG and GSR and the neuroimaging modalities fNIRS and EEG. Preferably in situ.
