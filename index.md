# Hellow Worlds of superhenrikkes worlds


### Intrests
Brains, yoga, though they have not been merged yet. I do experimental research on humans even thought I'm a mechanical engineer. The humans tend to somewhat interact with machines, important to mention. I also like books and semi-heavy weights.
