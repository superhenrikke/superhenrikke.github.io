## Henrikke Dybvik
I conduct experimental research on humans even though I'm a mechanical engineer. Humans tend to interact with machines, physical and virtual products. To understand the  interaction effects between humans and products/machines/systems/architecture/other humans I experiment with wearable physiology sensors, ECG and GSR and the neuroimaging modalities fNIRS and EEG. Preferably in situ.
