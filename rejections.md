# Rejections

Rejections are newer fun, but they do happen frequently, and so should they (out of scope, not good enough, not written clearly etc.). However, I think there should be more openness around the notion of rejections to make them easier and just another part a working day. This should in particular come from those authors with many highly regarded articles because I believe they have recieved their fair share of rejections. I was inspired by another academic to create a list of rejections (whom I currently don't remember, but I'll refer to them one I do). As a part of my pursuit to becoming who writtes higly regarded articles, I share the venues that have rejcted manuscripts I were a part of here.  

## I have been rejected from the following:
I have probably forgotten about some rejections, and so this list is not completely exhaustive, nor is it in any particular order.

- HICSS (2020 I think)
